This paper is clear and well written, however its contribution is rather limited and I believe it is very much at the margin of being suitable for publication. Much of the content is standard textbook material and the length of the paper could be very much reduced by simply citing the material rather than including it in the paper in detail. It also seems strange that results are presented, without validation, in Section 2, but Section 3 on continues to describe the algorithm. It would be best to provide a full description of the algorithm before results are presented, preferably with validation.
