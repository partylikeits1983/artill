# C++ Ballistic Calculator

This program implements the external ballistic 
model described 
in [this paper](https://github.com/mazonka/artill/raw/master/drag_anziam.pdf).

The program is written in standard C++11 with 
one library dependency 
on [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) that is included in sources
(no need to download/install it separately).

## What can you do with this program

3. Run ballistic trajectories with different options: 
wind, air turbulences, initial height above the Earth’s surface;
even send to space or orbit around the Earth.
4. Solve for ranges or max - the programs finds 
the angles (for both flat and high trajectories) for a given range.
5. Tune the drag coefficient function given some firing table data.

You would need to

1. Define basic parameters of the projectile: mass, 
diameter, length; and muzzle velocity.
2. Define drag coefficient function. If the function 
is not known, there is an option to generate this 
function from empirical data. See section Solve.
 
## How to build 

### Automatic build

First, check out `src` directory. Build `dlad` and build `drag`. If you have `make`, type `make` and it should build. As a direct option use `make PLAT=w` for Windows or `make PLAT=u` for Unix builds. If you do not have `make`, then build manually.

### Unix manual build 

1. Unpack `dlib.tar.bz2`
2. Place `dlib` directory inside `dlad`.
3. Compile dlibad.cpp, e.g.` g++ -std=c++14 -c dlibad.cpp`
4. Compile all cpp files (except alglib.cpp, timer_inc.cpp, timer_w.cpp) 
inside `drag`, e.g. ` g++ -std=c++14 -c -I ../dlad *.cpp`. This example 
command will actually spits errors on those files not to be compiled – that is fine.
5. Copy ` dlibad.o` from `dlad` to `drag`
6. Link all `.o` files, e.g. ` g++ *.o -o drag`

### Windows manual build

If you have gcc installed, then follow Unix build instructions. If you use MS C++ compiler, check its version – it should be 19 or above:
```
C:\>cl
Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.10.24821 for x86
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.
```

1. Unpack `dlib.tar.bz2`
2. Place `dlib` directory inside `dlad`.
3. Compile dlibad.cpp, e.g.` cl -EHsc -c dlibad.cpp`
4. Compile all cpp files (except alglib.cpp, timer_inc.cpp, 
timer_u.cpp) inside `drag`, e.g. ` cl -EHsc -c -I ../dlad *.cpp`. 
This example command will actually spits errors on those files not 
to be compiled – that is fine.
5. Copy ` dlibad.obj` from `dlad` to `drag`
6. Link all `.obj` files, e.g. ` cl *.obj /Fedrag`
