# C++ Ballistic Calculator

This program implements the external ballistic 
model described 
in [this paper](https://github.com/mazonka/artill/raw/master/drag_anziam.pdf).

The program is written in standard C++11 with 
one library dependency 
on [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) that is included in sources
(no need to download/install it separately).

## What can you do with this program

3. Run ballistic trajectories with different options: 
wind, air turbulences, initial height above the Earthï¿½s surface;
even send to space or orbit around the Earth.
4. Solve for ranges or max - the programs finds 
the angles (for both flat and high trajectories) for a given range.
5. Tune the drag coefficient function given some firing table data.

You would need to

1. Define basic parameters of the projectile: mass, 
diameter, length; and muzzle velocity.
2. Define drag coefficient function. If the function 
is not known, there is an option to generate this 
function from empirical data. See section Solve.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository is a clean fork of Oleg Mazonka's C++ library Artill. I decided to make a clean upload with a simple Jupyter Notebook as a simple user interface in order to improve the user experience of this repository.
